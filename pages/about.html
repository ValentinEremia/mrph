          <h3>A BIT ABOUT ME</h3>
          <h2>Hi, I’m Radu</h2>
          <p>
            My affinity for art
            began when I was a child - I always loved finding forms of self
            expression, mainly because I was painfully shy and had trouble
            expressing myself in spoken word. Photography was a path I explored
            out of sheer curiosity but soon became engulfed in this amazing
            medium. What I love about it the most is how it transcends time. Its
            an honest look at life. That's why I strive for authenticity in my
            work. When I'm not working, I still love to photograph, especially
            my family and son. I love going camping, traveling, reading good
            books, an excellent cup of coffee, good conversation and anything
            that makes me laugh. Normally, I'm pretty laid back and kind of a
            jokester - I have a weird sense of humor - and trying not to take
            life so seriously, but I also have a strong work ethic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, photography was a place for me to experience freedom: a
            creative outlet, somewhere to explore and play (and, an expensive
            hobby.) But I soon realised that photography didn’t only grant
            freedom to me as the photographer behind the lens; it gifted it to
            the people in front of the lens, too. Sure, there’s some technical
            stuff going on in between the shutter and the viewfinder, but
            there’s mostly something magical at work when you capture people in
            their element. And ever since that discovery, it’s been my goal to
            help people feel that joy with unique, personal photography that
            looks and feels like them. And where better than on their wedding
            day?
