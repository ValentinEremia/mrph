          <h3>BEHIND THE LENS</h3>
          <h2>Something About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My affinity for art began when I was a child - I always loved
            finding forms of self expression, mainly because I was painfully shy
            and had trouble expressing myself in spoken word. Photography was a
            path I explored out of sheer curiosity but soon became engulfed in
            this amazing medium. What I love about it the most is how it
            transcends time. Its an honest look at life. That's why I strive for
            authenticity in my work. When I'm not working, I still love to
            photograph, especially my family and son. I love going camping,
            traveling, reading good books, an excellent cup of coffee, good
            conversation and anything that makes me laugh. Normally, I'm pretty
            laid back and kind of a jokester - I have a weird sense of humor -
            and trying not to take life so seriously, but I also have a strong
            work ethic.

          <h3>CEREMONY, BANQUET</h3>
          <h2>Wedding Photography</h2>
          <p>
            Every wedding, just like every couple, is totally unique, so I never
            domineer or dictate anything on the day; instead, I follow the
            rhythm of how things are naturally unfolding, and capture what
            happens as it happens. The only time I’ll choreograph is group
            shots, if you want them, and this is only to get them over and done
            with as quickly as possible to give you more time for drinking and
            dancing!
